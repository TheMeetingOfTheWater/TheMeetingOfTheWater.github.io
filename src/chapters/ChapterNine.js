                    <p>A short distance from the former mill, Charles and I found the lane rose somewhat abruptly up to the junction with the main A396 Tiverton to Bampton road. The rush of passing vehicles snapped me out of an ambling state of mind into focusing onto the location my car, which happily stood in tact waiting for us at the nearby-lay by. Almost immediately in front of us, a road led up the hill in the direction of the village of Cove. It was somewhere, I had passed unnoticed on many occasions, but like so many encounters on foot, new vistas opened themselves and sowed the wish to explore in this neck of the valley. A few months later, I decided to do just that. The day chosen to return to the village of Cove, wasn’t particularly propitious.  The weather proved unyieldingly misty with occasional drizzle. Turning off the A396, I followed the lane that led past the old Cove Manor and up Cove Hill until I found the village hall. Parking there I began a little reconnoitre. The hall was originally the old school and the bell that summoned children over the years remains resolutely perched high on the gabled end of the roof. The hall is built of local stone with differing hues of browns, black and grey, adding a sombre tapestry against the grey wintery landscape. Running my hand over the stone work, the touch was cold, wet, sharp and uneven. It appeared as if the elements, over a century or more, had done little to soften its harsh cut appearance. The walls have held the world outside at bay protecting the silent world within. To the side of the hall, hung a war memorial to those who had perished in The Great War and it struck me how many of the names recorded here, may well have been those called out in the classroom as the register was being read out.</p>
                    <BigImage src={Media.img1} />
                    <p>I peered through the dirty windows trying to get a view of the interior of the hall and the kitchen, but in the gloom of the day, I could hardly see very much of the inside of the hall and kitchen. What, I could just make out were the stacked away chairs and fold up tables. Bare wooden floors and a few indistinguishable wall mounted displays. It struck me how alike so many community halls are in their essentials. A place for the gathering of people on any number of small or large events throughout the calendar of the year and the traditions associated with the seasons. Halls continue to host raucous celebrations of national events or the quiet privacy of the makeshift polling booth. They serve as the stage marking large family occasions to informal coffee mornings or Toddler Groups. Local traditions and rituals are often held in these halls during the course of the seasons. Halls reflect the tapestry of life with the displays of table tops festooned with an assortment of home grown produce and craftworks. Notice boards announcing Dances, performances, luncheon groups, keep fit classes, short mat bowls, Parish Council meetings and any number of clubs reflect the health and vitality of the community.</p>
                    <p>However, there are some marked differences between the halls that I have seen. Some are richly adorned and furnished, bedecked in flowers, framed photographs, maps and commemorative records. Others are sparse and bare. It seems to me that the older community tradition of bedecking their beloved churches has been matched with the importance of establishing village halls to serve in accommodating village life. Similarly, they both reflect the wealth of the community. In the past, churches very often had their own halls which provided host to religious gatherings, but also hosted secular events. In the aftermath of The First World War, many villagers and communities, chose to build Remembrance Halls as a focal point for their collective grief. At times, churches and Victory Halls (as they were often named) have complemented one-another, both providing a repository for the memory of the deceased and the bereaved. Where, community participation in a range of religious and secular activities has been strong and healthy, their numbers, support and income has been sufficient to support both in the annual rhythm of community life. From my experience in recent years, whilst village halls appear to be fairly robust in the life of the community, the falling congregations in churches has led to them increasingly seeking to develop themselves as a wider community resource to avoid closure. In increasingly atomised world, halls (and churches and chapels) offer important social opportunities as well as holding the collective memories of the communities. The record, James Ravilious, left behind of photographic studies of North Devon halls in use at times of jumble sales, commemorative lunches, fashion shows, provides a fascinating snapshot into the communal life of village halls. I observe the interactions between villagers amongst the stalls sharing gossip and familiarity. Those moments have long departed and turned a corner into a past ever receding and lost in time. And yet the echoes remain.</p>
                    <p>Occasionally there is a photograph of the Queen, usually above the fireplace (boarded up now) and often a commemorative plaque of the names of The Fallen in the Two World Wars and subsequent conflicts. Chairs and folded tables are almost invariably neatly stacked, a space in the middle of the room awaiting the next gathering. In the kitchen, kettles and teapots sit on a shelf and cups, saucers and plates cleared away and on the side of a draining board a few upturned flower vases have long since dried. I delight in jumble sales, fetes and performances, as times when these halls come alive. The first surge of potential customers entering the hall and making for the table tops that take their interest. Soon the room is bustling with people congregating around the table tops whilst others, strain their heads to peer over to their shoulders or their sides. Each table top holds a potential cornucopia of goodies ranging from home-made cakes, jams, chutneys and pies. Vegetables and fruit to other tables selling bric-a-brac; books, music, home-made crafts, clothes, toys, raffles, and hand-crafted wares. Each table top provides the potential to find bargains or serendipitous delights. It tests the haggling skills and reserve between buyer and seller and the social graces as people compete for items and negotiate the congestion. In the crescendo of table top scrummaging and transactions, there are those who elect for the refreshments and catering on offer; catching up with acquaintances or simply soaking up the atmosphere. Sometimes the bustle is stilled to allow for the calling out of winners for the raffle or allow a few gabbled inaudible words to be spoken. Gradually (and I speak from the experience of manning a table top) a more sated atmosphere descends on the hall. People have begun to leave and the stall holders now try and sell off as much of remaining items as possible. A few late arrivals or returnees, offer some of clearing unwanted stock and proceedings gradually wind down. Then, the task of packing up, cleaning and clearing away. I have been the one designated to ensure all the windows are closed, lights switched off and no stragglers remaining. Just as I turned for one last check, I have always marvelled at the stillness left behind.  </p>
                    <BigImage src={Media.img2} />
                    <p>I went to have a look at the former church of St John the Baptist which stands just behind the hall. It is now a private residence and understandably, access is restricted both to the home (church) and the garden (churchyard). It is possible to get permission to walk around the churchyard or see the inside of the church, but only by appointment. In fairness, many churches are locked today, something I have experienced on several occasions. Often, there has been a sign indicating some kindly soul who might be able to open up the church, but I have never thought to trouble them. It has always served as a valuable reminder of how fortunate those of us who enjoy parish churches are when we reach for the handle and find the door open. Walking up Cove Hill is a good steep climb and passes a number of new bungalows and houses, but also several older properties. I suspect these were formerly owned by the North-Row family of Cove House who in the 1922, sold the estate and allowed tenants to buy the properties. If I had been minded to keep walking, I could have stood atop Vanpost Hill and on a finer sunnier and most importantly clearer day. this would have been desirable. As it was, I turned back after a while to try and get a view towards the western slopes of the Exe Valley but the mist hid all but a few pockets of the woodland from sight and offered a sense of mystery. </p>

                    <BigImage src={Media.img3} />
                    <p>I decided to have a look at <b>Cove House</b> which stands a little outside the village, on a high promontory overlooking the River Exe below, but out of sight to the general public thanks to a half mile drive from its gated entrance to the front door. It also is screened by a surrounding 40 acres of woodland and fields. However, I was able to work out on the map, that there was a footpath that appears to follow the drive and branch off in the direction of St John the Baptist Church. I decided to give it a try and was well rewarded for my efforts as the house fairly quickly came into view. The house built in the 1820's, was home to Margaret FitzHerbert (nee Waugh) who, with her Husband, Giles (former Ambassador to Venezuela) bought the house and the estate in 1971 for £15,000. She lived there until her untimely death aged 43, as a result of a road traffic accident in 1986. I should add that Margaret was one of the seven children born to the novelist Evelyn Waugh and Laura Herbert and such pedigree must have rubbed off as she herself became a writer. Her biography entitled "The Man who was Green Mantle" 1983 was a reference to John Buchan's book based on her Maternal Grandfather, Col. The Hon. Aubrey Nigel Henry Herbert who was given Pixton Park (which appeared briefly in Chapter Seven).</p>
                    <p>I discovered an article that appeared in The Daily Telegraph (April 2003) entitled "Waugh and Peace" by Rory Bruce Knight, which gave a lively description of the house at the time of the sale, with the price estimated at 1.5 million pounds; not a bad investment all things considered. As I read the article, the house had become something of “a colony” with the children of Margaret and Giles, remaining in the house with its galaxy of rooms and their respective families. Claudia, one of the daughters, from the late 1990’s wrote a series of entertaining columns for the Telegraph under the title of "Stuck in the sticks" detailing the dramas and intrigues that existed between the siblings and other members of the family. There seems to have been warring factions and the household became divided into two camps dubbed West Berlin and East Berlin.</p>
                    <BigImage src={Media.img4} />
                    <p>As I walked up the drive, I decided to approach the front door and see if I could find out a little more about the house. The two front doors, tall and rectangular stood at the top of three worn steps, meaning that whoever came to answer the caller, had a definite height advantage. Whilst I waited for an aged butler to sniffly ask for the purpose of my visit, I looked around behind me, towards the drive I had walked up and the rolling grassland setting and the mature cypress trees. Judging by the colonnaded front porch containing a large cushioned armchair and two benches facing out towards the grounds, I imagined the current owners greatly appreciate the view too. I suspect they have a good sense of humour too, with a wooden monkey perched on one of the window ledges keeping an eye out for intruders. Once more I looked towards the doorbell. I don’t have one, but I know a good doorbell when I see one. In my job as a roving Community nurse, I have pushed any number of them and this one was particularly fine. A white button surrounded by a small circular metal indent. However, I remembered that on pressing the button, I could hear no sound the first time and likewise on the second attempt. By now, my nerves were beginning to get the better of me and the winning pitch, I had hurriedly devised, suddenly did not seem so convincing. I was almost relieved when it became clear no-one was in or answering. I decided to try and pick up the footpath that would hopefully take me close to where I had read, a spring fed pool with sandstone rendering was sited. In my mind, the pool had assumed an almost mystical charm, fed in part by the description that swimming had taken place there. At some point, chlorine had been introduced (heaven forbid!) and rightly caused a stir between the East and West Berlin Waller’s with one of the families who tended an organic allotment just below the spring. </p>
                    <BigImage src={Media.img5} />
                    <p>Making my way towards a worn stretch of grass that looked like a footpath led through tall Cedar and Beech Trees, towards a walled kitchen garden. Now, I was trespassing but the lure of the open gate to this promised land overcame any inhibitions. From now on, there was a fatalism about the consequences. As I passed through the gateway, I was greeted with the sight of several palm trees casting an exotic air to the December cool-grey morning. The interior of the garden was a world in hibernation. All the colours of winter were to laid out in the frigid borders where seed heads protruded over prostrate grasses and the lifeless bare stems of depleted herbaceous plant hung low. The surface of the pond had a dead stillness and as I stared down, I was awkwardly reminded of my presence in the reflection of my head and shoulders showing above an impenetrable silky darkness.</p>
                    <BigImage src={Media.img6} />
                    <p>Nearby was a lean-to glass house, the type favoured by the Victorian kitchen gardeners and in good repair and maintenance. In their time, they were as good a productive site than any polytunnel commonly found today and by far more attractive. And yet in keeping with the overall ambiance of the estate, the glasshouse had the air of neglectful bohemianism. The whitewash paintwork was peeling and cracked. Here and there, a pane or two of glass was missing. And although there were the withered remains of last season’s tomatoes gathered in a pile and numerous plastic plant pots scattered on the potting shelves, it lacked a horticultural heart and purpose. A few reclining chairs were spread about suggesting that this was now a rather grand place to repose on fine sunny days. There was, as I so often find in these decaying places, a beauty and lament to its former grandeur.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the kitchen garden, I came across a flat square of ground with two tennis poles still standing. Just below this, the bank dropped steeply to the side of the house, a view broken by the cluster of tall mature beech trees that part screen the eastern slopes. I had tarried long enough and seeing the house from this side jolted me out of what had at times, seemed like a trance. I made my way back down the drive and at the entrance paused to look at the makeshift sign pushed into the side of a hedge. This seemed to exemplify the decline of the estate and as such, reflects the similar affliction and challenges many old large properties face as the years go by.  I was nonetheless impressed by what I had seen and perhaps not a little grateful for the random opportunity to see this grand house and its estates aided by the footpath. So many estates fell into decline after The First World War. Many were broken up and sold off in parcels of land, contents and buildings. In time, what was left or neglected, fell into ruin or was eventually demolished. In some cases, new buildings or conversions have altered the landscape and the clues to its past are found in the remnants of steps or large ornamental trees.</p>
                    <p>If I had one over-riding emotion, as I walked down the road, it was a warm afterglow often associated in my mind, with having bagged a few potentially good shots of places or people or experiences. Perhaps, I would have made a Paparazzi in another life, but my interest in recording things lies elsewhere. Tucked away in the fragile workings of my camera, the little memory stick contains some momentary record of the days I spend learning about the places I visit. The photographs are shared and then stored away like a squirrel with its acorns and berries to be recovered at leisure.</p>

                    <p>The next two destinations, the villages of Oakford and Stoodleigh, were situated on the western side of the Exe. They came to my attention whilst researching for the book and to get there meant returning to the burnt-out cottage and the old arching bridge at Cove. Leading past the cottage is Dry Hill lane, which climbs some distance through woodlands, until it begins to level out by Stoodleighmoor. It was just past here, that I took a right turn at the chillingly named Hangman's Hill Cross. The name may bear witness to the unfortunate method of suicide a returning sailor or army deserter (depending on which account you chose) attempted on his way back to his home village of Oakford. The story goes that in fear of being exposed and punished for desertion, he was unable to seek financial support and guidance from the various village he passed. He may well have been in an already desperate state when he came across a local elderly woman. She was standing in the road, near to the cottage where she lived alone. The domesticated raven, she kept for company, perched on her shoulder, further disturbed the man's fragile state of mind and he was later found hanging. Without this this story, I might have assumed it was the name commonly given to a place where public executions were carried out. Their corpses left, as a reminder to others, what fate might befall them should they chose to become highwaymen or thieves or murderers. Gibbet Moor, just a few miles south west of this hill and passed by countless traffic on the main North Devon link road bears witness to this practice of a gibbet for hanging sheep stealers. </p>
                    <p>Hangman's Hill Lane drops down (no pun intended) spectacularly through meandering sweeps in dense woodland towards Iron Mill Bridge. Upon reaching the eerie-sounding Black Copse about half way down its steep descent, there was a feeling of becoming immersed into an earthbound lake of trees. The bare skeletal tree forms, denuded of leaves, still drew a curtain over the daylight creating quite a menacing dark subterranean atmosphere. Black Copse seemed very redolent with an uneasy feeling I experienced. Having parked by the side of the bridge, a convoy of assorted land cruisers filled with men in dark green Barbour jackets and tweed caps and barking dogs swept passed me. I had the slightly disconcerting feeling of witnessing a small army of swashbuckling mercenaries pass me by. Having passed and driven up the hill, I felt a relief when their sound petered out and the woodland was restored to its calm. Iron Mill Stream reasserted itself over the valley with the sounds of its swishing and swooshing motion as its waters careered down the sodden banks and under the low two arched bridge. For a time, I stood in the middle of the bridge and rested my hands on the cold metal sides; the top half painted white to help with navigation. </p>
                    <BigImage src={Media.img8} />
                    <p>The surrounding trees retained many of their autumnal coloured leaves which clung grimly to their host branches and twigs. They shared their domain with the thick matting of moss and lichen and ferns that clung to the bark. The ground was saturated, not only by the recent heavy rains, but also by the carpet of thick leaf cover that had settled across the woodland floor. This formed a trinity of three main colours; the hues of brown at the base, the clinging greens of rising columns of ivy and mosses and above the outstretched upper storeys of the trees was the pale grey leaden sky. Overlooking all this was the former Mill House; three storied with loft rooms and gabled roof, a large house by any standards (13 windows and 1 door) and land to the side, with what appeared to be holiday lets. The road leading out of the valley towards Hamslade Cross was particularly treacherous. Large potholes were spread like open sores and needed careful navigation and with the added risk of driving over the exposed side of the slippery road to the valley below.</p>

                    <p>However, as I passed the lodge gate cottage at the entrance to Stuckeridge House, I began to relax. The road towards Oakford, seemed more reassuring in open countryside. The car park was full which for a weekday, seemed surprising, until I came to understand the big hunting occasion that was taking place unseen in the sodden hinterland around me. I had on this occasion, a copy of The Kings England (1938) which by now, had become a staple part of my research. Oakford, the researchers for the book, was a place where "the pure Devon dialect is still naturally spoken" and "such is the air, the rector told us, that men over 80 still do a day’s work on the farm". If Bun Burrow was anything to go by, this is very likely still to be the case. I walked up Rookery Hill and had a quick exchange with a much-harried Postman, hurriedly trying to deliver heavy sacksful of cards in time for Christmas.  "It's ridiculous really" he said without a trace of a Devon accent. The village seemed, otherwise deserted. The Red Lion Hotel closed for business but there were plenty of signs of the run up to the festive period. Front doors were adorned with traditional wreaths and near the entrance to the church, a communal Christmas tree bedecked and jewelled and carefully fastened to a signpost. </p>
                    <BigImage src={Media.img10} />
                    <p>The church tower of St. Peter rises above the cottages below owing to its vantage looking down on this ancient settlement. Farming has been in the lifeblood of this community going back beyond the records of several manor houses in the area. Nonetheless, these manor house and their past owners find their mention on the tombstones and memorials in the churchyard and interior of the church. Of note, was an ornate 17c memorial tablet commemorating members of The Spurway Family including John Spurway who "dyed" March 9th 1692 aged 6 months and 14 days. The interior of the church was light and airy, enhanced by three stained glass lancet windows and the colourful display of ornamental prayer cushions spread across the pews and a forest of little Christmas Trees pocketed about the window ledges and by the sides of the church. This was St Peter's on show.</p>

                    <p>To the side of one of the windows was a brass memorial commemorating the death of Frederick Edwin (Derrick) Buller (1892-1914) who was killed in action whilst serving with The East African Mounted Rifles in British East Africa. The date given was the 25th September 1914 which means he was one of the first casualties of the First World War in this part of the conflict. I looked him up on the internet and discovered that he was the son of the local Rector, The Reverend Frederick George Buller and his Wife, Margaret Mildred (nee Anson). His Father served the parish between 1909-1924, although the vicarage was at Bampton. It seems as if the family had reasonable financial means as Derrick (as he was referred to by his family) went to Eton and later Trinity College, before buying a large farm in British East Africa (now renamed Kenya). He was one of the settlers who volunteered to join one of the locally formed units (possibly in Nairobi) which coalesced in the early stage of the conflict into The East African Mounted Rifles. In his book; 'Battle for the Bindu, The First World War in East Africa", Charles Miller (54) wrote how large numbers of settlers from all corners of this vast land converged on the capital Nairobi at the start of the conflicts. They arrived on "horses or mules and formed themselves into mini-regiments of irregular cavalry. Their weapons were fowling pieces and elephant guns, their uniforms tattered bush jackets and broad-brimmed terai hats with fish-eagle feathers protruding out from leopard- skin puggarees. They galloped through the streets of Nairobi brandishing steel-tipped bamboo spears that had been hastily fashioned by a local blacksmith. It was as if Nairobi had been over-run by vigilantes". Miller goes on to write that many of these volunteers had little or no concept of military discipline and regarded the whole things as a bit of an adventure that would soon be over, but what they did possess was expert horsemanship, crack shots and familiarity with the ways of the bush. My understanding is that Derrick served as a mounted trooper with 'C' Squadron, East African Mounted Rifles and was dispatched to The Ingito Hills between the Magadi Railway and the frontier with German East Africa as part of a force of 30 troopers under the command of Captain Chapman to protect the strategically important Ugandan Railway. The railway was at risk from attack from the German forces in the south and it was during one such incursion by a larger German force of nearly 200 troops that Derrick was killed. Aside from the loss to the family it might be borne in mind how many of his Etonian contemporaries came to grief over the next four years (particularly at The Battle of the Somme 1916) so that by the end of The First World War, Eton School had lost some 1,157 old boys. It struck me as I stood by the side of the memorial, how in the short space of four years, so many men from these rural parishes would never return to the United Kingdom and would end up buried in either mass graves or in foreign commonwealth cemeteries, the latter being where Derrick is buried at the age of 23 years. It also occurs to me as I write this, how often I have found myself writing more about the Dead than the living. </p>
                    <BigImage src={Media.img14} />
                    <p>In much the same vein, part of my interest in coming to the church was to find the gravestones for some of the Carew Family buried here. You may recall I have mentioned Stuckeridge House a couple of times now and the connection of The Daniel Family to its estate. I was helped in this task by a map of the churchyard and the names attached to each gravestone. So often, the stones become worn, overgrown or damaged rendering them indecipherable. On this occasion, I had the map and found the woeful gravestones of Thomas Carew Daniel (d. 04-05-1923), Louisa Dorothea (d. 22-03-1923) and John Francis (d. 17-04-1902) stood side by side on a modest plot alongside their former neighbours. Bear in mind the name Thomas Carew Daniel as we will come to him when we get to our next destination of Stoodleigh. For now, I wandered around the churchyard, looking at the craggy exterior of the church, built around the 13c and marvelled at its stone corbels of which two caught my eye. The first, a rather fearsome creature with a shrew like face and a terrifying grin bearing his razor-sharp teeth. The second, was a rather more humorous carving of a young man, full thick mop of hair and a pleasant smile. How I envied him that thick mop of hair and for that matter no wonder he was smiling. The Lych Gate stood side by side with an old Yew Tree and its roof was now covered with ferns, moss and lichen and through this I made my way back down though the village.</p>
                    <BigImage src={Media.img15} />
                    <p>At the bottom of Rookery Hill, lay a patch of wild wood. The recent heavy rains had saturated the valley and water was spilling across the road. I stopped to have a closer look at the woodland pocket. It was bordered by a bank rising from the road, acting to create boggy pool in the middle of the woodland. The bank was covered in a thick carpet of fallen leaves, but here and there, green stalks and grasses stuck out. Everywhere, branches, many with soft mossy clumps, hung over in a thick tangled mass.  </p>

                    <p>To get to Stoodleigh involved me driving in the direction of Pinkworthy Cross and here I met an unfortunate lorry driver, who was not having a good day. For the best part of an hour, he’d been trying unsuccessfully to figure out how to get to some cottage. He had found himself driving along the narrowest of lanes with sharp turns and unable to find directions or contact the householders. A few consolatory words were all I could offer. Whatever his private thoughts as I drove effortlessly away in my tiny little bimbling machine, he had the grace to keep to himself. The road took me down to the underworld of Spurway Wood and crossing the bridge, I followed the road skirting Great Wood that seemed to lead me up to the clouds. Everywhere was misty and the visibility almost non-existent. Not for me, the dazzling prospect of views far and wide from the vantage point of Stoodleigh Beacon.  At 987ft, it offers (so I understand) unapparelled views across Exmoor and Dartmoor. For this reason, instruction was given to sight a beacon on this promontory. The order to create beacons was issued by Edward II in September 1326, so that he could receive advance warning of his Wife's (Queen Isabelle) potential landing in The West Country. Fearing a rebellious invasion by his Wife and her lover Roger Mortimore ("the great romance of the Middle Ages"), Edward established a medieval early warning system. It didn't work. Queen Isabelle and her forces landed unbeknownst to Edward, on the eastern shores of England, rather than in the West Country and it was a matter of five days before news reached him of any landing. For Isabelle's part, it took her forces, a couple of days to figure out where they had landed. In the contest that followed, Isabelle was to prevail and within a couple of months Edward's regime had crumbled and he was forced to withdraw westward, eventually taking flight, first abortively to Lundy Island off the North Devon coastline and next to Wales. Here, he was captured, imprisoned and finally assassinated, probably on Isabelle's orders. </p>
                    <p>In fact, the Beacon has been part of a network of fire signals in Devon going back to Viking and Saxon times. They have been employed during the invasion scare during the war against Napoleon in 1804. At the time of Spanish Armada in 1588, Stoodleigh Beacon was, but one of 40 fire-signals (with an additional 90 prepared in anticipation of the Armada) and part of a network of prominent high points that afforded a position where a fire could be quickly lit in response to sightings from other beacons spread across the county from coast to coast and from neighbouring counties (55). It was estimated that if the system was properly managed it could alert a whole county within half an hour but that clearly depended on a number of considerations. In a system worked out during the reign of Henry VIII three beacons were called for to provide three separate levels of warning. One beacon indicated that the enemy had been sighted and to be vigilant; two beacons lit meant the enemy were showing serious intention of landing and the third that a landing had taken place. The response to this by neighbouring beacons was intended partly to ration the beacons by not using them unnecessarily as also to help locate which part of the coastline had become part of the invasion. So, the response to the first and then second coastline fire signal would usually only elicit one fire from the hinterland fires giving notice of warning and the third coastline fire signal would act as a signal to other inland beacons to light two meaning that following the fires back to the third indicated where the invasion was taking place and in principle mean that local militia could be galvanized to repel the invaders. Each beacon was constructed from trees although some were iron fire-baskets on timber supports or low circular stone platforms. Responsibility for these fire signals was delegated to the sheriffs, high constables and the justices of the county and in turn it was the duty of local parishes and magistrates to ensure that men were selected to act as sentinels (usually without shelter and forbidden dogs as they could act as a distraction!) and maintain these beacons at the Parish expense. A team of four men (armed) would take shifts in pairs day and night in maintain the beacons in readiness for use and ensure there was dry Furze, often more plentiful on the hill tops for lighting the wood. One inherent problem with this system was the possibility of false alarms and this had proved problem in the past but when in July 1588 the Spanish ships sailed in formation and the beacons were lit there was never any doubt that this was a much anticipated invasion attempt but the battles took place at sea rather than on the land and this ultimately is where the fate of the Armada rather than its dominion over the British Isles was decided. </p>
                    <p>At the place where in former times the beacon might have stood is now a tall transmission mast although even from the closest side of the road nearby I could at best only see the faint outline of its base and I could have easily been in the clouds because the drop down Coleford Hill and Rifton Wood seemed to take on the gradual descent experienced when travelling on an aeroplane. At Coleford Bottom the road passed over a small stream that winds its way down to Iron Mill Stream and from here I made my way up Rull Hill which passes Rull Wood; Rull Cross Farm and Rull Cross which is where I turned left at a triangular passing point with one of those comforting Devon finger posts for granted. During the Second World War with the threat of invasion, many old road signs were removed and only replaced with more modern versions and although Devon didn't experience the same degree of loss as other parts of the country in the 1970's there was talk of replacing or removing many of the finger posts throughout Devon but fortunately, they have remained very much part of the rural landscape. As I understand it (and at the considerable risk of revealing myself to be a complete finger post nerd) there are some 40 types dotted about the county coming in an array of sizes, lettering, material and design. Whilst I don't want to go into too much detail it is worth a glance at more than just the location you are seeking when passing these little features of the roadsides. This particular one was a modern variety (some go back to turnpike times 1836-7) with a finial with Devon Ship logo in black set against the post painted white. I also like their recording the names of the crosses or the location which helps with navigation. So, taking into account Rull Cross I did ponder on the meaning of the word, Rull. </p>

                    <p>Place names for villages, cities and towns (and landmarks) often derive their meaning from the location or some characteristic about the area and there are whole books dedicated to the origin of such place names. I quite like the humorous entry Chips Barber makes for Oakford, a village mentioned earlier as “self-explanatory so I won't explain it!" and this chimes with D. St Leger- Gordon who wrote; "there is always a danger of attaching too much significance to old place-names, so often bestowed from the sheer necessity of calling a place something. On the case of Wistman's Wood, the mere shape of hoary, bearded trees might have suggested ancient sages or priests. In reality, the name was probably derived from the Celtic Usig-mean-coed "the rocky wood beside the river"(10). I think Rull is a name of a family who very likely had connections to farming across Devon as the name appears in other parts of Devon (for example near Knowle Cross, Whimple) but beyond that I also discovered that Rull Cross Farm came up for sale as part of The Stoodleigh Court Estate in 1925 which included 20 farms including many of the farms I had passed on my travels here and had yet to explore. In addition to these farms the substantial inventory included the village of Stoodleigh; its post office, Assembly Hall and cinema, Estate Office and Agents House, Timber Yard, Smithy, Grocer's Shop, some 24 cottages including the intriguingly named 'Bleak House’, and numbers 1-5 Church Row, School and playground, Eastlands and Eastlands Lodge and various other properties and parcels of land around the area. The sale also included just over 2-miles of exclusive rights to the salmon fishing on The Exe and 4 miles Trout in Iron Mill Stream and 1,000 acres of woodland.</p>
                    <ChapterHeader text="Stoodleigh Court" />
                    <p>The sale took place on the 4th, September 1925 at The Rougemont Hotel in Exeter and included Stoodleigh Court House, a grander home built on the site of the former Manor House commissioned in 1885 by Thomas Carew Daniel (1848-1923) whom I mentioned during the visit to the parish church of St Peter in Oakford. A photographic portrait of him shows him to have a kindly face, smiling half-turned, large moustache in that Edwardian style and attired in thick tweed suit and waist coat. 'Squire Daniel' as he became locally known, inherited the estate at the age of 33 years in 1876 and became almost literally "principle owner of the soil" as it's hard to imagine anywhere he didn't own within quite a wide circumference from the main house. He inherited the estate from his Grandparents as his Father Thomas Daniel had died at the early age of 39-years leaving his Widow, Dorothea to manage the estate. Thomas Carew may well have had reason to relish the benefits and status of such an inheritance as he was a keen huntsman and fisherman and the estate would have offered him plenty of opportunity to indulge in these activities. Up to this point had been educated at Eton and served as an officer in the Life Guards but now that he had such an estate, he threw himself into the expensive business of making many improvements in keeping with his status as a Justice of the Peace and High Sheriff. In 1883-4 he had the former Manor House completely re-built and then in a short space of time donated significant sums for the reconstruction of the nearby parish church of St Margaret's which included the installation of new bells and an extension to the churchyard. All these works or rather the cost of them benefited the village, but ruined the state of his finances and in 1885, he was forced to put the estate up for sale. For his part he moved and may have married Alice Mildred (who died in 1897) but what is clear is that he and his Sister and Brother were buried in St Peter's churchyard and not (as many of his forebears) in the churchyard of Stoodleigh where he had invested so much of his money (49). As to the estate, it was bought by Sir Edwin Harris Dunning, a former diamond and gold dealer from South Africa who went onto become Mayor of Tiverton (his bust is still in the council office in Tiverton) and was later knighted in recognition to his services to The Liberal Party. It was during the time that Sir Edwin and his Wife, Lady Hannah Louise (nee Freeman) lived at Stoodleigh Court that many village events took place and are part of a booklet written by Carol Shore and aided by Connie Marsh in a booklet (sold out at the time of my visit) entitled 'Stories of Stoodleigh’ (56). The couple continued the benefactor example (if not the financial rectitude of its previous owner) of providing employment for many villagers as well as building farm cottages and houses that remain to this day and it was to the village hall, situated along West End Lane and once part of Ford Barton that I arrived at first and parked outside to have a wander.</p>

                    <p>A long building containing what was once referred to as the Assembly Room and also used as a cinema at times. To the rear is where Ford House, the agent’s office was located. As far as I understand it, the Grade II- listed agricultural buildings and farmhouse that form part of what is called Ford Barton today were, at the time of the former Stoodleigh Court estate known as Home Farm. A peek at the outside of the barns gave ample evidence to their sorry state and the impression was reinforced by a notice pinned to a gatepost in March 2017, some nine months to the day I stood looking at it, that Mid Devon Council were similarly concerned about its condition. When I do the rounds so to speak, of the countless barns, farm-houses, cottages, dry-stone walls, hedges and trees of Devon's patchwork of farms, I like the aging character and reclamation of Nature on these landmarks, small and large. I feel a witness to their decline as well as appreciating a certain beauty or interest they hold. I know from experience of being involved in dry-stone walling, hedge-laying and clay puddling that each stone placed; every layer of cob mixed and laid, bricks lined and wooden frames handled and inserted has been part of the life of generations of labourers over the centuries. The fact that such buildings were built to serve the needs of running a farm did not always detract from the trouble taken in many constructions to give them a touch of the pride in their creation and pride in the overall estate. The fact is I appreciate them all no matter how utilitarian and makeshift. They all bear witness to endeavour and form part of the rich layers of heritage to be found in the countryside. However, change happens and from the 1980's the trend accelerated in many old-style Devon barns being sold and re-developed for conversions into dwellings or offices; former farm labourers cottages sold into more general commuter ownership and as land was sold retirement bungalows become more ubiquitous. There was one remnant that in Summer I could so easily have missed but in the openness that winter offers with views hitherto hidden by the surge of growth in spring and the dense canopy of summer, I caught sight of a winter wonder world. Just across the road from the hall and the entrance to Ford Barton was a small pool of water; its edges lined with green grasses and the surface of the frigid water glassy and reflecting with fidelity to image of the micro world above. Surrounded by rhododendrons, hazel and holly, the tinted remnants of the beech leaves clung like ornamental hanging decorations above the under-storey of this small piece of undisturbed woodland. Thick layers of autumnal leaf mould mixed with the spread of ivy as it colonised the floor and found its tendrils up many of the trees in this little oasis of calm.</p>

                    <p>I made my way into the village by way of a road that took me past the approach to the former Stoodleigh Court House but I have the impression that I have been there in the very distant past. Before I get to this mini footnote a little more history of the house is required. Sir and Lady Dunning had four children and their youngest Son, John Denzil Dunning DSO (1892-1917), South African born was 22 years of age when the First World War broke out. In a photograph that appears in many books on the history of Naval Aviation he can just be seen in the cockpit of the Sopwith Pup biplane as it careers over the side of the flight deck of HMS Furious with a number of ratings trying unsuccessfully to grab the tail plane and one onlooker with his back to the photographer in a frozen posture of terror as the tragedy unfolds. By chance my route took me past a place he would have spent some of his short life growing up in and in the process of researching this book I felt I could honour his memory in a small way by writing a little about his life. The background to this event lies in Denzil's aptitude for long distance aerial reconnaissance whilst flying seaplanes for the fledgling British Royal Navy Air Service and saw him decorated with the Distinguished Service Order in March 1916 for his part in acting as a spotter and photographer. He also was wounded in June 1916 while bombing enemy territory and engaging in a fight with German Seaplanes. Added to which he was mentioned in Dispatches for service at Gallipoli.  By 1917 The Royal Navy had embarked on a trial to adapt flight decks to existing battleships as a means of carrying and launching land planes (as opposed to seaplanes which were judged to be inferior as interceptors) aircraft with the role of reconnaissance and meeting the Zeppelin threat. The challenge came in designing a flight deck capable of allowing planes to allow sufficient flying speed as well as provide a runway capable of allowing planes to land without them being ditched into the sea. The light weight and frailty necessary to enable small aircraft to launch and land in restricted conditions also proved the undoing of Denzil in the cockpit of his Sopwith Pup as he attempted to land on the flight deck of HMS Furious on the 2nd August 1917 and in achieving this, he became the first pilot to make a such a landing. He repeated this for a second time just five days later. However, on landing the plane was caught by an updraft of wind that lifted the plane causing it to topple into the sea below whilst the helpless crew were unable to prevent this from happening. The report was that Denzil was mercifully unconscious when he drowned in his cockpit (57). His body was recovered and taken from the naval base at Scapa Flow, Orkney where the trials had been taking place and brought down to be buried next to his Mother's Grave at St Lawrence Church, Bradfield, Essex.</p>
                    <BigImage src={Media.img19} />
                    <p>My impression is that the family hosted a number of large events at Stoodleigh Court and I note that reported in the Devon and Somerset Weekly News of September 7th 1905, "Guests numbering 500 were entertained by Lady Dunning at lunch and tea in a large marquee on one of the terraces. Between the meals there were sports, scrambles for the children, tug of war, Aunt Sally, and minstrel entertainments by a party from London; and music performed by the Tiverton Volunteer Band under Mr Baker, and all spent a most enjoyable afternoon"(56). Accompanying the article mention is made that the event was to celebrate the coming of age of their eldest son, Frank Dunning. meaning that Denzil would have been 13 years-old at the time and I couldn't help wondering if he might not have been one of the children, all turned out in their best suits and dresses, hats and shoes staring up at the paper's photographer. It is entirely possible too that whilst his three younger siblings may have been at the gathering (certainly Frank at any rate) Denzil may have been away at Dartmouth or sea as by the tender age of 13 he was serving as a Midshipman in The Royal Navy and prior to that at a boarding school in Lansdowne Terrace, Eastbourne, East Sussex at the age of just nine years-old meaning that he could barely have spent much time at Stoodleigh Court because in 1908, The Dunning s put the house and estate up for sale and moved to Jacques Hall, Bradfield in Essex and the new ownership passed on in two fairly quick successions until the last owner bought the house and the estate in the early 1920's. </p>
                    <p>The new owner was Mr Frank Shearman who had bought up a number of former Royal Navy ships with the intention of setting up a merchant shipping company, however the scheme proved unsuccessful and he was made bankrupt forcing him to sell the house and the estate in September 1925. I gather the house was the last part of the estate to be sold and was bought in 1928 to be used as a Public School and renamed Ravenswood. I am pretty sure that I played Rugby there whilst I was a Chorister at Exeter Cathedral School and if it was there, I can vividly recall running about on a vast open pitch in pretty miserable winter’s weather and poor light. The school continued up until 1992 when falling numbers of pupils forced its closure and I understand the house now functions as a hotel and hospitality setting.  </p>

                    <p>The road past Stoodleigh Court joins Rackenford Road and leads down to Quoit-at -Cross (an old burial site) and a lay by near to The Stoodleigh Inn and this is where I parked. Just as I was alighting from my car, I saw a man park up behind me and gathering a bunch of flowers and a bottle of wine make his way in my direction and smile when I enquired if they were for me as it would have got my vote for Stoodleigh being the most welcoming village in the whole of Devon. He at least had the grace to smile at this feeble attempt at a joke and said they were intended as a peace offering to his beloved which I suspect was a far better cause. Anyhow leaving him knocking on one of the cottages I weighed up whether to call in at The Stoodleigh Inn or walk down towards the church and return later to the pub. And it was the latter decision that ruled the day as I walked down Church Style, past some fine-looking thatched cottages until I came to a fork in the road taking me past a farmyard and along Church Row and into the large churchyard of St Margaret's. I have three main memories of my visit to the church and churchyard and the first was how impressed I was with the Yew Planting. There is one very old solitary Yew that easily predate the avenue of Yews that lead up to the West facing gate that in turn crosses the road and leads into a beautiful green path surrounded by tall elegant Beech trees and in days gone by was a direct link between the church and Stoodleigh House and I imagine was regularly used by processions of Ravenswood Boarders as they made their way to the pews and back from Sunday Prayers. The West Door has an interesting and unusual metal sign of a pointing finger on a left hand screwed to the wooden door directing the walker towards the main porched entrance which has sight of the ancient Yew Tree or should that be three trees as at some point in its 1000 years or more the tree split apart and has had a strengthening wall built around its base dating back to 1712 and five years later a bench circling it, recognising its use as a meeting place. The bench is no longer there but the wall is, cracked in places no doubts as the base of the Yews have expanded. </p>
                    <BigImage src={Media.img21} />
                    <p>The remaining two highlights were to be found in the interior of the church itself, or more specifically on the ceiling and for this I confess I took a leaf out of Roger Deakin's strategy of lying down (in this case on the floor rather than on one of the pews) for looking at the church ceiling at St James, Kings Nympton in North Devon. For like him I had “an appointment" not just with one Green Man but several displayed on the waggon roof ceiling. In his wonderful book, ‘Wildwood. A Journey through Trees’, Roger Deakin (58) visited St James on the 24th, August 2002 and I know this because having read the book and in particular his chapter on The Sacred Groves of Devon I wanted to visit the church where he begins a delightful account of an expedition to locate as many of the Green Men and churches with the names Nymet, Nympton or Nymph "of which there were at least thirteen".  Green Men is part of a medieval tradition of woodcarvings found in churches (amongst other places) in which the human face (invariably male as far as I can see) is wrapped in foliage or has it growing out of various parts of his face although most commonly through the mouth and the meaning of these icons is unclear although they exist across Europe in places of Christian significance. Roger Deakin suggests The Green Man draws a very personal response from each and every one who gazes upon his effigy and he himself expresses a likening to the spirit of rebirth and the cycle of life and the seasons. When I have looked at them, I often have wondered if their proliferation around Devon has something to do with the woodlands that must have been far more present in the landscape at the time of their creation. The bosses in the church (all 33 of them) date from the 15c and include an exotic range of subjects including a two-legged dragon, four with mermaids and others with heads that appear beneath prickly foliage perhaps referring to the snares of the Devil and I do wonder with such an eclectic mix of symbolism no doubt intended to visually reinforce the strictures of faith to the congregation, if there was not an older tradition these Green Men were drawing on in their similarity to the Woodwose of Medieval literature and Art. Translated to The Wild Man of the woods and perhaps drawing on the much older tradition of Silvanus, the Roman God of the Woodland.</p>
                    <BigImage src={Media.img22} />
                    <p>The third impression was the extensive work made in 2010 to repair the timber frames that supported the six bells donated to the parish church in 1867 by the Father of Thomas Carew Daniel whom I have briefly set out his story. Whenever I visit a church, I hope to be able to step into the tower where the bell ropes hang and there are the imprints of a Bell Ringing Tradition that goes back many hundreds of years to the late Middle Ages when the mystery of the Sacrament was enhanced by the ringing of the bell and use of Incense. By the 15c the ringing of hand bells had become a feature of the liturgical year adding to the sense of occasion and effect of such rituals as the beating of the bounds and driving away evil spirits and invoking blessings on the harvest to come. Bells were seen as vessels that could not only banish evil spirits but drive away their demonic handiwork in the form of lightning and thunder.  The Reformation and the pursuit of Iconoclasm that followed in its wake did not necessarily stretch to bell-ringing (no pun intended) as it remained as a signal that the sermon was about to be read but did extend to the ringing of tower bells on occasions such as Funerals and All Saints day as idolatrous. Church bell ringing was banned during the Puritan period of the 17c along with the pursuit of sport and other activities that were considered ungodly or the dregs of Papery. As is so common in History there were periods of reaction followed by reform and gradually the sway that Puritanism began to loosen particularly during the Restoration period with the enthronement of Charles II and a steady return to the adornment of parish churches throughout the land and the return to the churches binding role in the adherence to religious and community activities. Bell-ringing once again took a regular part in the calling and celebration to religious and ceremonial occasions and has become imbued in the culture we continue to celebrate today and harks out to a more ancient sound and evocation on a quiet outing in a rural parish.</p>
                    <BigImage src={Media.img23} />
                    <p>Bell-ringing has a long-established tradition in Devon as evidenced in part by its Guild of Devonshire Ringers being founded in 1824 and being the oldest in the country. St Margaret ringers are affiliated to the Guild, a fact commemorated in a framed certificate outlining the mission statement of the Guild in the kind of language that today seems old-fashioned. Perhaps not surprisingly I quite liked it. At the top of the page is an impression of the front of Exeter Cathedral and below a call to encourage a religious sense of purpose to the bell-ringing; "to recognise the true position of ringers as church workers" and "to encourage Ringing for Divine Service" but it does also offer something less exacting in promoting "good feeling among Ringers". It ends with two belfry prayers; the first to be read before Practice or the ringing of a peel and the second prayer to be said before the ring of a service. Having done a few stretches of bell-ringing in the past (no pun intended by the way) I can vouch for the fact that this didn't happen but it is possible to imagine that it was very much part of the ritual in the lives of those former Bell- Ringing Teams seen in yellowing and fading black and white photographs encased in fraying wooden frames hanging in the Tower Rooms. The images in colour (usually of poor quality) of more recent teams (1960's onwards) stands in marked contrast to the formality and sombreness in these older team portraits and its worth considering the differences. More recent photographs show team members casually dressed, often standing in the tower room with the ropes hanging to their sides whereas in the older photographs the teams are usually standing and sat in two rows by the West Door of the tower in more formal attire. The older teams are exclusively made up of men (although I have heard of women taking part in the 1940's) but as the make-up of present-day teams will bear witness there is a much more even mix to be found. By contrast the number of younger bell-ringers are not so evenly matched with shall we say the more mature members of the teams and this may point to a problem of continuity for the future and may explain why the Guild of Devon Ringers is collaborating with its rival organisation; The Devon Association of Ringers (more youthfully founded in 1925) to jointly recruit 1400 new members in recognition of the similar number of Bell- Ringers who were killed during The First World War. It is hoped to reach this target in anticipation of Armistice Day 2018 when there will be a massed Bell-Ringing Tribute.</p>
                    <p>It is worth remembering the silencing of Church Bell-ringing under The Defence of the Realm Act 1914 which amongst other restrictions included the prohibition on people buying binoculars; giving bread to horses and chickens; buying brandy or whisky in a railway refreshment room or buying a round in a pub. The banning of ringing church bells also came to being and remained in place right up until the false hope of Victory at The Battle of Cambrai (1917) when the initial success was greeted by sanction for church bells to be rung. The next time the bells were heard was with the cessation of hostilities in November 1918. The onset of the Second World War (1939-1945) saw a similar ban and the ringing of bells was intended to be a warning for any invasion which seemed like a distinct possibility in the early stages of the war. In 1942 the mass ringing of bells announced the Victory at El Alamein in North Africa and the American Landing at Morocco and Algeria at a time when Churchill proclaimed "this is not the end, nor is it the beginning of the end, but it the end of the beginning". And so, it was and by 1943, the Government relaxed the rules a little allowing the ringing of bells on Easter Sunday and lifting the ban completely in May 1945 with V.E Day celebrations. Very often there are tablets commemorating the ringing of bells on certain occasions like Coronations and the number of peels and the names of those who took part. Many of the names of team members bear witness to their years of service in the belfry as well as their familial relationship to past and present members. If I think back to a time, I used to visit my late Aunt, Dorothy Payne at Langford Park Nursing Home at the turn of the millennium I recall one gentleman resident who had lived his entire life in Newton St Cyres and worked as a jobbing Gardener and rung the church bells at the parish church of St Cyr &St. Jullita for most of his 100 years. He was a truly wonderful man who seemed blessed with few regrets and a ready smile. He planted a walnut tree on his 100th birthday along the drive up to the home and on one occasion when I took him down in a wheelchair to see the tree, he asked me if I take him down the following summer to see the tree although sadly, we never got a chance to do that. I will always remember him not least because he told me that from any hill around mid-Devon, he could make out the sound of peels coming from the patchwork of parish churches spread across the area and I don't doubt for a moment that George must have rung the bells in each and every one of them.</p>
                    <BigImage src={Media.img24} />
                    <p>There was the third thing that caught my eye and made an impression and it’s not the first time I've noticed Bequests presented on tablets (by way of memorials) and attached to the church walls, both inside and out. As part of the refurbishment to the church tower in 2010 many of the memorials were given a much needed clean and one tablet stood out for me. It was a memorial dated 27th October 1668 to the legacy bequeathed by Miss Elizabeth Carew for the poor of Stoodley (the spelling then for Stoodleigh today) and Crocombe, in Somerset. She left two hundred pounds each for these parishes to be administered for the relief of the poor and also had purchased an estate at Bishop's Lydeard in Somerset so that the profits from the rent would provide for future relief. The tablet engraved in 1827 provided an update or what might be called a Progress Report today. In November 1819 timber was sold from the estate and the amount of eleven pounds, nineteen shillings and one penny were placed in the Taunton Savings Bank as credit for this charity. In 1724 a William Abraham gave ten pounds for bread for the poor of Stoodleigh parish and the leftover interest on this to be distributed annually. Perhaps what this reveal is not only the wishes of the congregation to find favour in the spiritual world beyond but also the role of the parish church as a kind of social service of the day; a means by which could be administered and overseen. Churches occupied an active part of the secular as well as spiritual life of the community in a way many churches are seeking to find a way back into now. Such thoughts got me thinking about a distant relative of Miss Elizabeth Carew in the person of Thomas Carew Daniel who lost his Father at the age of 14 years, came into his inheritance at 33 years and within the span of 9 years had lost his beloved estate and rather than be buried in a churchyard he had paid to have extended along with the bells he had added to the tower play at his funeral he was instead buried somewhat ungraciously at the parish church of Oakford. </p>

                    <p>By now I felt hungry and in need of a cup of coffee and decided it was time to return to The Stoodleigh Inn. Upon entering and asking if they were selling any food, Lizzie, the landlady told me the pub was actually closed, but very kindly agreed to make me a cup of coffee. So, taking my place on a stool by the bar I waited and looked around. Three men were chatting amiably enough with a familiarity that showed they knew each-other pretty well. One of the men was bemoaning that his Wife "was on one and had been all morning, so I've come to the pub to get right out of the way". It seemed to my eves-dropping ears the obvious point to ask what was wrong but his friends simply said not to worry. It would be alright and he seemed to accept this without any difficulty or protestation. A case of Job done! Next Patient please. As I was reflecting on a lifetime's career as a Psychiatric Nurse clearly wasted in seeking to explore what might lie behind such statements, I faced the chilling possibility that I had been on the wrong path. I must have wasted countless hours by not adopting this stripped down no-nonsense, non-psycho-babble therapeutic approach. So much for Nursing School; it is to the village pubs that I should have been assigned. And then I recalled an earlier encounter with a man I'd seen getting out of his car and clutching a bunch of flowers and a bottle of white wine. He told me it was a peace offering for his beloved. This must be secret to maintaining harmonious relationships in Stoodleigh. When I pieced together the evidence there could be no doubt about it. I felt a terrific sense of gratitude towards these wise men and for that matter towards Lizzie who came in clutching a mug of coffee and a tray of rolls. "You can have these for free" she said “they were left over from the meet we had here earlier and they'll only go to waste". I was in the company of esteemed Pub Psychotherapists and now presented with solid proof that there is such a thing as a free lunch. But as I tucked in I did wonder whether it would be polite to leave a few on the tray so as not to appear greedy but my attention was then drawn towards a large screen and playing was a selection of 1980's Christmas Hits with Shakin Stevens performing on one of the cheesiest schmaltzy video's ever with all the clichés of snowball fights, a dodgy looking Father Christmas and the obligatory log cabin in the snow and fire burning brightly by the Christmas Tree.</p>

                    <p>Looking around the bar were arraigned Christmas tinsel draped conveniently over framed portraits of Stoodleigh's past with gatherings of Villagers, something less visible today; standing somewhat bemusedly or sternly towards the camera. There were also more recent photos of hunting parties in full regalia. This got me thinking about the history of Hunting in Devon which perhaps took on a recreational aspect (as opposed to purely for food purposes) with The Romans and more noticeably with The Normans. Lots of things have been hunted too sometimes to the point of extinction in Devon, for example wild boar, wolves and bear but there has also been the hunting of Otters and hares and stags but these have been dwarfed by the hunting of the fox. Having lived in South Devon, as a boy I had been vaguely aware of fox-hunting and the meets that formed around Woodbury Common with the spectacle of the hunters in their full regalia, trumpets calling, snorting mountainous horses dressed and bristling, the loyal toasts and the packs of impatient barking hunting dogs. On the few occasions I witnessed the meet at Woodbury Castle on Boxing Day or that matter gave Hunting any thought I considered it part of a long-standing countryside tradition and that has certainly been one of the arguments put forward by those opposed to the banning of hunts. When weighing up my thoughts I also recalled a few occasions when I have been high up on Exmoor and suddenly (and unintentionally) found myself navigating past long processions of cars, vans, scooters and spectators following the course of a stag being hunted. I suspect one person who would have little qualms about the nature of hunting would have been Charles Palk Collyns (1793-1864) who hailed from Kenton, near to The Exe Estuary and decided to follow his Father's profession as a Surgeon and go up river as it were to Dulverton where he lived and worked and from him there were three generations of Collyns serving the community in the Medical Trade. He married Anne Moore (from Spreydon House near Broadclyst) in 1816 and the couple went on to have eight children and if he wasn't busy enough, he seems to have relished Stag Hunting as he was one of the founders of the Devon and Somerset Staghounds (1837) and described the activity as "the greatest source of relaxation and enjoyment".  Towards the end of his life he sat down and wrote an account of Hunting and there little doubts his enthusiasm for the pursuit of Deer across the two counties. His book entitled Notes on the chase of the wild red deer. Devon and Cornwall (58) provide a description of these pursuits over a period of 1780-1838 and they are quite though-provoking.</p>
                    <p>Thinking back to the start of our walk from Exe Head and knowing a little of the terrain we covered I couldn't help feel some awe at the desperate chase given to a stag in 1838 which began its flight from the moorland at Hawkridge and then made its way to Simonsbath, past Exe Head and onto Prayway Mead and up to Oare Common and eventually Culborne Wood which dropped down to Porlock Bay and the Bristol Channel. It isn't clear exactly how many tortuous miles the poor creature had to run to try and escape the hunters and the stag hounds, but reaching the sea the stag made a desperate bid to shake off his pursuers. The huntsmen tried to find a boat to reach the stag but they were beaten to it by a passing merchant vessel that spied the action and made for the stag. Somehow, they managed to capture and lift the stag onto their deck and took it to Bristol where it was exhibited in the market to spectators willing to part with sixpence a head. There was another occasion recorded where passing seaman profited from a stag having been chased for two and a half hours had wound its way to a smugglers cove near Glenthorne and jumped into the sea. The stag was captured and taken to Cardiff and sold for meat. </p>
                    <p>Much of the land these hunts crossed belonged to Frederick Knight mentioned at the start of the book in relation to Pinkery Pond) and it appears he was keen to encourage hunting on his land to the point where he claimed there were no bogs on Exmoor (I can vouch for the fact that there are!) only soft places and clearly he hadn't heard the tale of Moles Chamber where a rider and his horse had sunk into the bog and were found in a perfect state of preservation thanks to "the antiseptic qualities of the peat" some 50 years later when the bog was drained. The most gruelling chase that I could find and one that appeared closest to unsettling Collyns took place on May 16th 1820. The hunt began appropriately enough near Huntsham Castle and a chase ensued that criss-crossed the Exe around Cove and Stuckeridge, over Oakford Bridge, widening to Easdon and Knowstone Moor, through many woodlands, over farms, hills and eventually up Oreford and onto Culborne Hill. Only this time the stag did not make it to the sea not that would have necessarily saved it, but instead was felled by the ensuing pack and dispatched. Collyns signs of the seven-and-a-half-hour hunt or ordeal depending on your point of view as "a very arduous day". Speaking of traditions, I have yet to see the clamour for the old ritual of presenting the severed head of the hunted stag with a silver cup strapped by a cord to the open mouth of the stag. The cup was then filled with "some favoured toast and presented to all the huntsmen, whippers, farmers and others" to be drunk to the full by each. On drinking the toast each participant was required to then tilt the head right over towards his chest to show that the cup had been left empty. Having had my fill of coffee and as many rolls as I felt I could eat I thanked Lizzie for her kind hospitality and climbed into mar car nearby. Homeward bound.</p>
                    <ChapterHeader text="Iron Bridge" />
                    <p>There is a road I wish I had taken but will have to be for another time. It is known as Carscombe Lane although for a time it was referred to as New Road or The Drive and it was paid for by Thomas Daniel in 1839 to improve access to his estates at Stoodleigh Court and Stuckeridge House. On the map it appears no mean undertaking as it wiggles its three-mile way down to the steep highlands towards the Exe and I understand it was intended to link up with what is now called Iron Bridge which crosses the Exe and meets with the Tiverton to Bampton road. There may well have been a much older bridge in existence but in 1863 a new bridge was constructed and paid for by Thomas Daniel complete with a Lodge and pillared gates. In her account of Stoodleigh, Carol Shore (56) records the 1954 memories of a Mrs Kelly, a niece of Thomas Daniel, complete with a photograph of the entrance to the bridge and the Lodge taken in 1926. The gates and the pillars have long gone but the lodge remains. Mrs Kelly recalled that villagers of Stoodleigh were required to have a pass to cross the bridge and that a Gatekeeper and his Wife would open the gates for The Daniel Family as they drove by carriage across the bridge. The route of the new road was designed to provide fine views from its climb up to the village of Stoodleigh with the rise of Shilhay Copse to one side and the valley below and the stream that rose from a spring and further fed by the surrounding hillsides.</p>
                    <p>Thomas Daniel had planned to create a series of ornamental ponds by damming the water at intervals and had created pools in nearby Fairby Wood on the opposite side of the river and close to Iron Bridge and if you look on the map there remains Fairby Fish Ponds to this present day. Mrs Kelly recalled how on uphill walks with her Father who was the rector at Stoodleigh Church they would make use of a well found near the steepest part of the lane. The well was covered with a wooden door and inside a "dark dripping spring hung around with moss and tiny ferns”. (56)</p>
                    <p>My journey home, however, took me in the direction of Stoodleigh Barton and the dramatic drop down towards Parkhouse Water which lies several hundred feet below. At times the road straightened out and felt disconcertingly like one of those ski slopes where skiers gather speed and then launch themselves into the air. The drop was accentuated with the view of tall wooded hills in the distance and the valley floor way down and I certainly didn't need to follow any advice to check my brakes. I seemed to be passed at intervals by several squadrons of men zipping up the hill on quad bikes. One would be driving and another riding pillion and all were wearing green Barbour coats or camouflaged outfits but they all seemed friendly enough as they courteously acknowledged my pulling over to let them pass. I guessed they had been part of the hunt and perhaps employed as beaters but there was something about the rasping noise of the quad bikes and the speed that disturbed me. Stoodleigh had been so quiet and undisturbed by traffic or human occupation and although I was a visitor, I felt this Green force something of an invasion with its noisy machinery and irreverent racing. I thought how The Green Men of Stoodleigh Church or indeed the Woodwose might feel about this mechanised force charging across the fields, lanes and beloved woodlands churning up the soil and disturbing the wildlife.</p>

                    <p>Perhaps it was a trigger to a general recognition that in such a relatively unspoiled part of Devon I worry about the threat to the countryside and our rural settlements in the general degradation too often found in the poor management and loss of soil, woodlands and hedges; pollution and littering; loss of wild areas or green corridors and diversity. It struck me how the actions of making bequests or gifts to the community said much about the sense of connectedness and continuity people had not only with the Church, but the community and the land around the villages in the past. In Stoodleigh as in so many villages the church was a reminder of this found in the tablets stating clearly bequests to the poor and in effect the rector acting as a kind of social worker in administering alms and of course there was the estate owner and their beneficence in the form of cottages, allotments, charitable funds as well as refurbishment to the church. It is easy to over-simplify and romanticise these things but there are tangible lessons to be reminded of in the past stewardship of estates, farms and village structures that we are the poorer to forget and the choices we make in exploiting the land for short-turn gain needs to be set against what is left for the future sustainability. My journey took me down past Easter lands, Bare hills Wood (which seemed oddly named as it was anything but) and through the heavily wooded Valley sandwiched between Withy cleave Wood and Hatherland Wood. Eventually I reached a fork in the road and drove towards Iron Bridge and crossing this noticed “Mr Rudie”, as he is locally known, busy painting the exterior of his house. Perched up a high ladder. A paint tin in one hand and a brush in the other, it seemed he may have been using a novel technique of balancing himself. Whatever, method he was using, you may well appreciate that this was one occasion where I felt it was best not to distract someone going about their business.  </p>
